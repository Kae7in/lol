# Fast Iteration Update - Frontend Integration

## âœ… Fixed the Slow Edit Experience!

The create page was using the old `/api/ai/iterate` endpoint which takes ~2 minutes.
Now it uses the new `/api/iterate/fast` endpoint which takes ~8-10 seconds.

## Changes Made:

### Frontend (`src/routes/create_.$id.tsx`)
- Changed endpoint from `/api/ai/iterate` to `/api/iterate/fast`
- Simplified request body (removed `currentFiles` - not needed)
- Fixed error handling

### API Types (`src/lib/api-types.d.ts`)
- Auto-generated types for the new endpoint
- Proper TypeScript support

## Performance Improvement:
- **Before**: ~2 minutes per edit
- **After**: ~8-10 seconds per edit
- **Speedup**: ~12-15x faster

## How It Works:
1. User types prompt in the chat
2. Frontend calls `/api/iterate/fast` 
3. Claude analyzes (minimal output)
4. Groq rewrites files
5. UI updates with new version

The user experience should now feel much more responsive!
